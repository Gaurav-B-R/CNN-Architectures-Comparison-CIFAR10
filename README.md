# CNN-Architectures-Comparison-CIFAR10
This project compares the performance of two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It evaluates the impact of adding an extra convolutional layer, analyzing both training and testing accuracy. The code includes training, accuracy evaluation, and loss visualization over 20 epochs.
